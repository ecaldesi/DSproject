Total out of 40 points.

Main goal: make a general layout template for the different classes and use inheritance and coomposition to link them. 

15 points: base classes are made for North Dining Hall and South Dining Hall with appropriate members and functions.

10 points: there are multiple classes that use hineritance from the two dining hall classes. The set up is correct, the members are correctly used. The classes handle the meal choice, and the different meal choices. 

10 points: there is an algorithm that calculates the calories of each food for dining hall quantity based on the information found on the Internet (because the dining hall menus don't display the calories). Develop a way to read in from a file and add those values as a member of each food class. 

5 points: program compiles correctly.
